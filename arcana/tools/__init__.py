Arcana tool subsystem.

This module provides the infrastructure to detect and wrap needed tools for various
build platforms.


The current categories are as follows:

* compilers - Tools that explicitly translate a higher-level language into machine-code or assembly
* linkers - Tools that combine multiple object files into a single unit.
* other - Any other tools, like objcopy, objdump, strip, gdb, etc.
